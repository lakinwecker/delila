It's a bit tricky because you're mutating DOM that is owned by Elm and are breaking some of the assumptions that the virtual dom engine expects

It can be done though. There's a few pieces to this:
1. Create a DOM node with an id in your `view`
2. Use `Html.Keyed` to make sure Elm doesn't re-render it and wipe your widget.
3. Use a port to send the id to some JS and tell it to embed at the time you want the widget to show up (this could be in your `init` or later on in the `update`)
4. You may want to wrap the JS code in `requestAnimationFrame` to sync it up to Elm's render-loop
